# 🚀 START HERE - Quick Testing Guide

## You Have Two Versions

1. **index.html** - Original (safe, production-ready) ✅
2. **index-modular.html** - New modular version (needs testing) ⚠️

---

## 🏃 Quick Start (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Start a Web Server

Open Command Prompt in your project folder:

```bash
cd C:\Users\HP\Desktop\Projects\before-after-photos

# If you have Python:
python -m http.server 8000

# OR if you have Node.js:
npx http-server
```

### Step 2: Open Both Versions

Once server starts, open in your browser:

1. **Original**: http://localhost:8000/index.html
2. **Modular**: http://localhost:8000/index-modular.html

### Step 3: Quick Test

Do these basic tests in BOTH versions:

1. ✅ Sign in with name and city
2. ✅ Click camera button
3. ✅ Take a "before" photo
4. ✅ Take an "after" photo
5. ✅ See combined photo appear
6. ✅ Check photo has BEFORE/AFTER labels

**If both work the same → You're good! ✅**

## ❓ What If It Doesn't Work?

### Error: "Cannot use import statement"
**Fix**: Make sure you're using a web server (not opening file directly)

### Error: Camera doesn't work
**Fix**:
- Allow camera permissions
- Use Chrome or Edge browser
- Make sure you're on `localhost` or `https://`

### Error: Page is blank
**Fix**:
- Check browser console (F12)
- Look for red errors
- Try the original `index.html` first
