üîπ Option A (what I just gave)

We use the universal single photo ratios we agreed on:

Stack Mode photo = 4:3 (width > height), vertical phone

Side-by-Side photo = 3:4 (height > width), vertical phone

üìê Crop Recommendations
1Ô∏è‚É£ Stack Mode (vertical stacking)

Combined aspect ratio = 2:3 (portrait)

Best for: Instagram Stories, LinkedIn portrait, 4:5 portrait posts

Target Template	Crop Method	Amount to Crop	How to Crop
1:1 (square)	Crop top/bottom	~15% total height	Center the combined photo vertically. Crop ~7.5% from top and bottom each.
4:5 (portrait)	Crop top/bottom slightly	~7% total height	Center vertically. Crop ~3.5% from top and bottom.
16:9 (landscape)	Crop sides heavily	~50% width	Center horizontally. Crop ~25% from left and right each. Less ideal but possible.

Tip: Always crop symmetrically from center to maintain the subject in the middle.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Side-by-Side Mode (horizontal stacking)

Combined aspect ratio = 3:2 (landscape)

Best for: Instagram landscape feed, Facebook landscape, Blog images

Target Template	Crop Method	Amount to Crop	How to Crop
1:1 (square)	Crop left/right	~15% total width	Center horizontally. Crop ~7.5% from left and right each.
4:5 (portrait)	Crop left/right and slightly top/bottom	~10‚Äì15% width, <5% height	Center both axes. Crop proportionally.
16:9 (landscape)	Minimal crop	~5% height or less	Mostly fits. Crop top/bottom slightly to reach exact 16:9.

Tip: Side-by-side mode favors landscape templates, so minimal cropping for 16:9.

üìå Summary of Approach

Always center the crop on the combined photo.

Stack Mode ‚Üí prioritize portrait templates.

Side-by-Side Mode ‚Üí prioritize landscape templates.

For extreme ratios (16:9 in stack mode, 4:5 in side-by-side) ‚Üí crop will be larger; use optional content-aware cropping if your app supports it.
